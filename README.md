# Perl Catalyst Advent Calendar - 2012

It's time again for this year's [Catalyst Advent Calendar](http://www.catalystframework.org/calendar/2011/)! 

## How to write an article?

The Catalyst Advent Calendar is using the [POD](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html) format. 
For each day of the month there is a corresponding pod file into the `root` directory.
If you don't feel comfrotable to write the article using the POD format, don't worry. 
Into the `examples/` directory of this repository there are few examples from previous years.

If you have any ideas, questions or you need help with your article you can always join IRC [click here to start instant web chat](http://chat.mibbit.com/#catalyst@irc.perl.org).

## Where is the repository hosted?

http://dev.catalystframework.org/repos/Catalyst/trunk/examples/CatalystAdvent/

## How to begin?

```shell
  svn checkout http://dev.catalystframework.org/repos/Catalyst/trunk/examples/CatalystAdvent/
  cd CatalystAdvent/root/2012/pen/
```

write a draft of your article into the "pen" directory. Once you are ready with you article, just move it to CatalystAdvent/root/2012/xx.pod 
(where xx is the day when your article will appear online).

  For example: `CatalystAdvent/root/2012/25.pod`
